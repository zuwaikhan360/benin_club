  history:
    "The Bus Stop Section was founded in 1982, about 40 years ago, during the Presidency of Mr. I.K Afe. The section gained popularity quickly and congregated as an informal group around 1981, before being officially recognized as a formal section in 1982. At that time, air-conditioned lounges and bars were a privilege that most sections and the main club building did not enjoy. However, the Bus Stop's cold room housed the first air-conditioned lounge and the club's first digital TV decoder. Credit must be given to the past president and diamond member of Benin Club 1931, St. Davis Elaiho JP (THE LIVING SAINT), a founding member of the section who single-handedly wrote the letter of recognition for Bus Stop and facilitated its approval as a formal section.",
  history2:
    "Engr. Gabriel Osemekhian, a founding member and a history custodian of the section, Barr. Austin Okwechime, a founding member and the first Chief of Protocol, Past President Sonny Akpata, also a founding member and a three-time chairman of the section, and Mr. Emeka Amanfo, a sales / marketing executive with the UAC Group who was attached to the MDS unit (Manufacturers Delivery Services), also played critical roles in convincing club members across various sections to embrace this new budding group. \n Over the years, the Bus Stop Section has been known as the heartbeat, intellectual, and conscience of the club. Traditionally, the captain of the section is referred to as the Chairman, and the Bus Stop Section is the only section without any sport activities. The section conducts the annual Manifesto Night that precedes its elections, arranges visits to orphanage homes to share palliatives and be a part of their challenges, and organizes lectures to discuss contemporary national issues and more. \n Since inception, the section has had 17 chairmen, including Chief Jim Ovbude, Chief J. Ikikiru, Mr. John Omo, Mr. Ian Forster, Mr. Jimoral, Chief J.B. Momoh, Mr. Paul Oseh, Mr. Harris Unuigbe, Mr. Sonny Akpata, Mr. Sam Ekezie, Alh. Lawan Bala Issa, Barr. Jefferson Uwoghiren, Mr. Justin Ofili, Prof. Edoba Omoregie, Mr. Ik Osunbor, Barr. Lucky Ayomoto,Mr. Sunny Omonzokpia and our current chairman, Dr. Isaac Omorogiuwa. The section also has a Grand Patron Hon. Rasak Bello Osagie and 13 Patrons, including St. Davis Elaiho JP, Mr. Victor Ikponmwanba, Dr. Omoregie Ukponmwan, Mr. Moses Aroko, Mr. Sam Ekezie, Hon. Charles Idahosa, Mr. Collins Ehinebo, Diokpa Justin Ofili, Mr. Frank Ize-Iyamu, Barr. Jefferson Uwoghiren, Barr. Lucky Ayomoto, Chief Isaac Ikekhuame JP, and Engr. Steve Ayiyi. \n The section is known for recognizing and rewarding hardworking personnel accordingly, as seen in the case of the immediate Past President, Pharm Fred Iboi, who was awarded the Millennium Achievers Awards and Bus Stop Ambassador of Change for his tremendous developmental strides in leaps and bounds across the entire club. While not a member of the Bus Stop Section, Pharm Fred Iboi's vision aligns with the ideals of the section, and the members are proud of his accomplishments. Similarly, Chris Uba was rewarded for his efficient running and management of the Benin Club bar, which resulted in the highest bar sales in the history of the club in the year 2022. The Bus Stop Section of the Benin Club 1931 remains a noble section that upholds the values of selflessness and recognizes hard work and dedication.",

  history: 'The game of Darts was introduced into Benin Club as far back as the early Seventies (70s). And this was courtesy of the large expatriate population in our midst at that time. For the records, Darts is a very popular pub game in foreign climes and our expatriate community comprising staffers of Guinness Nig. Plc. BLCC (A Telecoms Giant), Sem-Edo Wire Industries, Edok-Eter- Mandilas Ltd. (A Foremost Civil Engineering Construction Company). And some UNIBEN lecturers experienced no difficulty in establishing this fabulous indoor game in Benin Club which rapidly attracted a sizeable number of Members from the Nigerian Members of the Club. On a lighter side, it is said that the Game of Darts goes down very well with rounds of chilled lager. And more often than not, Darts boards are usually situated around bars. This was the case with the Darts Section of old as it was more or less attached to the Main Bar in the Main Club building.',
  history2: 'The Darts Section has come a long way since inception and some of the Members who held sway here (before the Millennium) include late Mr. John Omo, Ian Forster, Adams Lawal, Harris Unuigbe, Ken Enahoro, and Osayomore Joseph. We also had Mr. and Mrs. W. Otabor, Cyril Okosieme, Ambassador Emma Nnaji, James Nnaji, Ochuko Ukueku, Gabriel Osemeikhian and a host of others. Coming to the game of Darts itself, Darts is very simple to learn and very easy to play. The traditional Games are TDB and 501 and basically, the Game is all about aiming at numbers on a round board. How prolific you become therefore is simply a matter of how proficient you are at aiming. Sports is a dynamic activity and today to encourage variety, variants of the 01 Game have been introduced and these include 201, 301, 701 and others. \n  As a result of the growing number of Members, the Darts Section was relocated to a more spacious site on top of the table tennis Section in 2013 during the administration of Late Chief Sam Iredia. Since then, activities have continued to blossom. At this point, we must recognize some of the Modern day entrants into the Section who have made significant contributions to the glory of the Section in one way or the other. They include Messrs i.e. Enzewigbo, Vitalis Okpalanozie, Late Gideon Ezeudu ( Aka SB) , Comrade  Fred Omo  - Igbinoba ( Deceased) , Sunny Nketa,  Lawrence Umeh,  Ike Mbaka, Jude Onwuka and Chief Isaac Ikekhuame, to mention a few. Emblazoned on the walls in the Darts Section are the words ‘’Darts is Life’’. But in an irony of fate, death has inflicted much pain on the affairs of this Section resulting in the unceremonious demise of some of its illustrious Members. Even then, the Darts Section shall continue to survive and exist. The Section was until recently led by Comrade Fred Omo-Igbinoba  As Captain (Now Deceased), Chief Laz Aniagbaoso as Vice-Captain (now Acting  Captain), Pastor Julius Oluwole as Treasurer and  Engr. Gabriel Osemeikhian  as Secretary. Finally, this Section is where it is today as a result of good leadership over the years. Since inception, the Section has enjoyed healthy and progressive leadership and some of those who have had the Priviledge to lead the Section include: \n  Adams Lawal (In 1988), Harris Unuigbe, C.Y. Udoh,  Ochuku Ukueku (In 1992), Uyi, Bazuaye, Titus Okhuo, Ngozi Ebeye (In 1995/96), Osayomore Joseph, Innocent Enzewigho, Sam Avwiaka, Ayo Ogungusi, Gideon Ezeudu, Barr.

These include tractors, green mowers, brush cutters, logistics vehicles and other essential facilities. \n It is pertinent to mention that the Golf Section has produced some of the best Golfers in Nigeria and this is due to the never ending support from Donations to the Golf Sections. Donations and Sponsorships of any kind to the Golf Sections helped in the growth and expansion of its facilities and infrastructure. The Golf Section hosts tournaments on a regular basis, with Golfers from all over the country participating in them. This continues to be possible due to support and assistance from individuals and corporate bodies. \n Our membership however cuts across a broad spectrum of people from all walks of life. We have over 150 active golfers and having these equipment and facilities will help increase the standard of play and make it more enjoyable. \n Over the years, the baton of leadership has moved through 47 Captains. \n Undoubtedly, the game of Golf is for Noble minds.

    'This particular spot of the Upper Lounge of Benin Club became sort of a mecca to young professionals who are members of Benin Club after close of work.

  history: 'The Table Tennis Section is one of the nine (9) registered sections in Benin Club and it is an attractive destination to associate with as a new member. In fact, such is it’s growing appeal that it is now a destination of choice in the scheme of things. The game of table tennis was introduced into the sporting calendar of Nigeria from the south-west geopolitical zone. This was as far back as the early sixties but it was only established in Benin Club in 1990 by Mr. Bimbo Shoyoye, who was the sitting President at the time. To facilitate the gestation of this nascent group, he approved the immediate construction of a building (a bungalow) to house the new section. At inception, the section comprised a mere handful of followers namely  Mr. Bimbo Shoyoye (the President ), Mr. Edgar Oshodin, Late Emma Okoro – Obaraiye, Mr. Patrick Ojugbeli , Engr. Gabriel Osemeikhian, Prof. Stephanie Eghedosa, Dr. Flora Ukoli  and one or two others.',
  history2: '    A major attraction and advantage of the game of Table Tennis is the fact that it is an indoor game and this makes it very convenient for its several adherents to participate at their convenience. Over the years, the membership strength of the Section grew concurrently with the Club’s growing population and this prompted the need to develop a more spacious and befitting structure to house the Section. Consequently, the existing bungalow was rebuilt into the present day edifice which consists of an air-conditioned playing Pavilion, Lounge and Mini-Bar. \n   This Section has had a glorious past. Going down memory lane, one can comfortably claim that this Section has built-up a rich history of its own. At the height of its glory some twenty (20) or so years ago, the four walls of its hallowed pavilion harboured what was arguably the hub of social camaderie and razzmatazz in this Club. Back then, the facilities in the Main Club were a far cry from the 5- star status they now parade and this prompted some members to go in search of a conducive venue to relax and unwind and somehow the Table Tennis Lounge met their expectations. Notable amongst this group of adventurers and early members of the Table Tennis section were the Late Prince Cliff Ogiugo (of singer sewing machines) and Mr. Erhahon of Erhahon Block Industry. The group also paraded Late Emma  Okoro  Obaraiye, Mr. Kingsley Agbonnaye  who was then the P.R.O. to the Rubber Board, Mr. Dele Ogbeide of the famed Ogbeide  Boutique,  Mr. Ehisuta  of Ehisuta stores ( a big  Textiles  conglomerate in New Benin Market), Mr. Reti Uzzi, Chief Kenester Oteyekpen, Chris Avboraiye, Barr. Chris Agbonwanegbe, Mr. Efe Guobadia of blessed memory and a host of others. This group made a tremendous impact in the scheme of things in this Club at the time. However, this era gradually faded into history as a new crop of members took over in the section. Today, if you walk into the Table Tennis Section on a good day, you will find a sizeable number of members present and exercising themselves playing game after game of Table Tennis. Dr. Henry Obasuyi, a Medical Doctor, is the current Captain of the Section and more often than not, you’ll find some of the following members amongst the happy group playing – Barr. Solo Eimuhi, Peter Osemwekha Esq., Mr. Fred Rekuoya, Alh. Hassan Aliyu, Peter Jaboro, Mr. Lucky Osarenkhoe, Mr. Joshua Toba and some others. \n   Much later in the evening, members get down to the lighter side of Clubbing, which is to chill down with cold beer, suya, pepper soup and what have you. And this is usually the point when the Sections “Pillar” and Leader Hon. Charles Idahosa, OFR, JP holds court, regaling those present with juicy political talk. This is the Table Tennis Section for you on a typical day. \n   The incumbent captain is Dr. Henry Obasuyi, a medical doctor. However , this Section is fortunate to have had the following as its captain over the years  Louis Ojomoh Esq; Dele Ogbeide, Efe  Guobadia,  Reti Uzzi, Chris Agbonwanegbe Esq, Engr. T Ehiorobo,  Dr. Matthew Oriakhi, Barr. Solomon Eimuhi, G. C. Igbokwe (San), Pharm. Fred Iboi, Edwin Ero, Louis Odumegwu, Lucky Osarenkhoe And Egerton Oriakhi . \n   The Table Tennis section also boasts of an array of eminent personalities, as its patrons namely, Prince Oguigo, E. Okoro Obaraiye, Francis Ola Akinnifesi (Supreme), Dr. O Ukponmwen, P. Osemwekha, Lawson Ugiagbe, J. Ehiorobo, Dr. Matthew Oriakhi, Pharm. Fred Iboi, Henry Omoregie, Esq, Barr. G.C. Igbokwe (San), Barr. Solo Eimuhi, Engr. Osato Edo- Osagie, Hon. Rasaq Bello- Osagie, Barr Chris  Agbonwanegbe and Mr. Nicholas Jonah .\n  Hon.
